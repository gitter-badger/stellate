# What is Stellate?

Stellate is a Twitter clone, at its simplest form. But, as you can see, it's
also open source! That means that everyone can contribute and we benefit from
high quality tooling that integrates directly with GitHub.

While developing Stellate, we strive for three things:
1. Complete test coverage
2. High code quality
3. Good documentation

For that, we have Codecov and CodeClimate set up (with good results, as you can
see).
